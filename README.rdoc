Setlist Maker is a simple app that allows people to remotely collaborate on a setlist of songs.

Simply create an account using github, or your own email, add new songs with a link so your friends and bandmates can hear the song. Once a new song is created, you can create a new setlist and add those songs accordingly.

Users can share their setlists with anybody, however only the creator of the setlist can edit and add songs.

GETTING STARTED:

-to get started fork this repo
-run "rake db:migrate" once in the text editor
-run "rails s" to run on your browser.
