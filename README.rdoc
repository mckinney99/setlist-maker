Setlist Maker is a simple app that allows bands and musicians to remotely collaborate on a setlist for a show, album, or any other type of song arrangment. 

Simply create an account, add new songs with a link so your friends and bandmates can hear the song. Once a new song is created, you can create a new setlist and add those songs accordingly.

Users can share their setlists with anybody, however only a the creator of the setlist can edit and add songs.

Enjoy!
